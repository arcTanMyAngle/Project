# Character-Level Forensic Analysis Model 🕵️‍♂️

Welcome to the Character-Level Forensic Analysis Model project! This project aims to develop a state-of-the-art forensic tool for identifying the author of a given text based on their unique writing style. 📝

## Overview 🎯

The Character-Level Forensic Analysis Model is built using Python 3.12 and leverages the power of deep learning to analyze text at the character level. By utilizing character embeddings and a bidirectional LSTM network, the model learns the intricate patterns and characteristics of each author's writing style. 🧠

What sets this project apart is its focus on character-level analysis, which captures fine-grained details that word-level models might miss. This approach enables the model to identify authorship with high accuracy, making it a valuable tool in forensic investigations. 🔍

## Features ✨

- Character-level analysis for capturing intricate writing patterns
- Bidirectional LSTM network for sequential learning
- Trained on the extensive EMNIST dataset using the Kaggle API
- Achieves high accuracy in author identification
- Serves as a foundation for a comprehensive forensic tool

## Getting Started 🚀

To get started with the Character-Level Forensic Analysis Model, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository:
2. Install the required dependencies:
3. Open the `character-level-forensic-analysis-model.ipynb` notebook in Jupyter Notebook.
